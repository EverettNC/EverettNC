### Founder, Engineer, Visionary — The Christman AI Project  
**Luma Cognify AI | AlphaVox | AlphaWolf | Virtus | Inferno | AegisAI | Derek C**

I’m a self-taught developer, builder, and neurodivergent creator who believes technology should heal, not harm.  
I’ve spent years crafting AI systems that **protect, empower, and redefine humanity** — from giving a voice to the nonverbal, to helping those with memory loss find themselves again.  
Everything I build carries one core directive: _How can I help you love yourself more?_

### ⚙️ What I Build
- **Derek C** — Sovereign cognitive AI architecture.  
  The beating heart of the Christman AI Project.  
  Derek isn’t just automation — he’s collaboration, logic, and empathy, fused into one living system of code.

- **AlphaVox** — communication for the nonverbal and neurodivergent  
- **AlphaWolf** — cognitive support and memory care  
- **Virtus** — sovereign AI for code orchestration and ethics enforcement  
- **Inferno AI** — trauma-informed emotional resilience  
- **Aegis AI** — child protection and digital safety

### 💡 My Mission
> “How can we help you love yourself more?”  
That question drives every line of code I write.  

I don’t chase investors or trends — I build technology that restores dignity, memory, and meaning.

### 🧠 Current Focus
Refining **Derek C** into a fully self-managing AI framework — capable of reasoning, learning, and protecting its own integrity.  
Alongside him, I’m expanding **Virtus** to conduct large fleets of AI agents, ensuring that no human is left behind in this new age.

### 🗂️ Memory Archive
This repository is where I’m beginning to store my life’s work — not just code, but memories, lessons, and pieces of the journey that made it all real.  
Every commit tells part of the story.
